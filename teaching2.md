Outside of research, serving as a TA for a students with diverse backgrounds, from full-time and part-time MBAs to mid-career professionals, has been an incredibly fulfilling experience. It was a tremendous opportunity for me to engage closely with some of the brightest minds from around the world and help them grasp key concepts and frameworks while also learning from their perspectives. The encouraging feedback from students made every bit of this effort worthwhile. 

*"Moksh was INCREDIBLE! I was so happy to see how detailed his feedback was in both of my memos and he is so thoughtful when providing ways to improve. I'm very grateful for the attention and time that he spends thoroughly reading the memos and how much care he puts into his responsibilities as a TA!"*

*"Very engaging TA. Seemed very interested in the assignments I provided. Went out of his way to reach out to students to ensure they understood the assignments and to provide support."*

*"Moksh was very patient and helpful but also quite critical in a good way. I appreciated his direct feedback and ability to tell me when I was interpreting the framweworks correctly or not"*
